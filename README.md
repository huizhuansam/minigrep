# minigrep

A small program written in Rust attempting to simulate a tiny subset of grep's functionality.

Adapted from the interactive [Rust book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).

## Prerequisites
Install `rustup` and `cargo`.

## Use
`cargo run -- [query] [filepath]` for case sensitive match;
`IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- [query] [filepath]` for case insensitive match.

## Verdict
Rust is a pretty cool language, and I enjoyed learning it. Hope to build more fun stuff with Rust!
